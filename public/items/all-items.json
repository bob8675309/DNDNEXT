You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental} property\n\nThe Soul Trade\n\nOne section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.\n\nMammon's Tax\n\nWhen the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from {@spell True Resurrection}. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse.\n\nNegotiation Tactics\n\nThe tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer {@damage 6d6} necrotic damage.\n\nTranscribed Spells\n\nThe spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll ({@dice 1d4 - 1}). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would.\n\nDestroying the Tome\n\nDestroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.\n\nThe second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.",

Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\n\nArmed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\n\nLater, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n\nMagic Weapon\n\nThe Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nWhen you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the {@dice d20} for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.\n\nThe axe has {@itemProperty T|XPHB|Thrown} with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra {@damage 1d8} Force damage, or an extra {@damage 2d8} Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n\nBlessings of Moradin\n\nWhile attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n\nDarkvision\n\nYou gain {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet. If you already have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB}, its range increases by 60 feet.\n\nFortitude of Stone\n\nYour Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.\n\nGifts of the Creator\n\nYou have proficiency with {@item Brewer's Supplies|XPHB}, {@item Mason's Tools|XPHB}, and {@item Smith's Tools|XPHB}.\n\nOne with the Forge\n\nYou have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Poison damage and {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Fire damage.\n\nSunder\n\nWhen you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.\n\nConjure Earth Elemental\n\nWhile holding the axe, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to summon an {@creature Earth Elemental|XMM}. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe axe has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} property\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} properties\n\nTravel the Depths\n\nYou can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast {@spell Teleport|XPHB} from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.\n\nDestroying the Axe\n\nThe only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",

The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The {@spell shield} spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.\n\nWhen you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage to the target.\n\nHurling\n\nThe battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nIllumination\n\nWhile holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.\n\nSentience\n\nAzuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15.

The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.\n\nIf someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a {@spell wish} spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.",

Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThis artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nProperties of the Mortar\n\nThe mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.\n\nProperties of the Pestle\n\nThe pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nThe pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPerfect Tools\n\nWhile holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB}, and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\n\nPrimal Parts\n\nAs an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\n\nTraverse the Night\n\nIf you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.\n\nYou don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\n\nBones Know Their Home\n\nWhen you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\n\nDestroying the Mortar and Pestle\n\nThe mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the {@i Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga} or by Baba Yaga herself.",

If you hit an Undead with this weapon, you take {@damage 1d10} Necrotic damage, and the target regains {@dice 1d10} {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. If this Necrotic damage reduces you to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, Blackrazor devours your soul (see \"Devour Soul\" below).\n\nWhile you hold this weapon, you have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} and {@condition Frightened|XPHB} conditions, and you have {@sense Blindsight|XPHB} with a range of 30 feet.\n\nDevour Soul\n\nWhenever you use Blackrazor to reduce a creature to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul unless it is a Construct or an Undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell.\n\nWhen Blackrazor devours a soul that isn't yours, you gain {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the slain creature's {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} maximum.\n\nHaste\n\nBlackrazor can cast {@spell Haste|XPHB} on you, after which it can't cast this spell again until the next dawn. Blackrazor decides when to cast the spell, which takes effect at the start of your turn. The spell lasts for 1 minute (no {@status Concentration|XPHB} required) or until Blackrazor decides to end it, which it can do at the end of any of your turns.\n\nSentience\n\nBlackrazor is a sentient Chaotic Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.\n\nPersonality\n\nBlackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.\n\nDespite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be reunited and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.\n\nBlackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes 3 days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.\n\nDestroying Blackrazor\n\nBlackrazor can be destroyed by crushing it in the great gears of Mechanus. Primus, the creator of the modrons, also knows a series of musical tones that Blackrazor can't stand to hear, causing the sword to shatter.",

    "item_description": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\n\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n\nThe staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains {@dice 2d8 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain {@dice 1d8 + 2} charges.\n\nPower Strike\n\nWhen you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra {@damage 1d6} force damage to the target.\n\nSpells\n\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: {@spell cone of cold} (5 charges), {@spell fireball} (5th-level version, 5 charges), {@spell globe of invulnerability} (6 charges), {@spell hold monster} (5 charges), {@spell levitate} (2 charges), {@spell lightning bolt} (5th-level version, 5 charges), {@spell magic missile} (1 charge), {@spell ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or {@spell wall of force} (5 charges).\n\nRetributive Strike\n\nYou can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a {@chance 50} chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\n\n\nAnimate Walking Statues\n\nYou can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the {@creature walking statue of Waterdeep|wdh|walking statues of Waterdeep}. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n\nDispel Magic\n\nYou can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast {@spell dispel magic} on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n\nDrain Magic\n\nThis property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n\nMaster of Enchantment\n\nWhen you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n\nPersonality\n\nThe staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\n\nIn the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n\nSpirit Trap\n\nWhen the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\n\nDestroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.",

As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.\n\nOther creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes {@damage 24d6} Radiant damage. This damage ignores {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} and {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB}, and it can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} by this damage disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes, and the creature's {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to it ends.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\nCelestial Calm\n\nWhile attuned to the book, you have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} and {@condition Frightened|XPHB} conditions and {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.\n\nDivine Wisdom\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\nEnlightened Magic\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\nHalo\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}. While present, the halo gives you {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion|XPHB}) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead within the halo's {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} make attack rolls against you with {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB}.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} properties\n\nDestroying the Book\n\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed.

    "item_description": "The contents of this foul manuscript are the meat and drink of the wicked. It contains knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites doom.\n\nMost believe the lich-god {@book Vecna|XDMG|8|Vecna} authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every horrid idea, every corrupt thought, and every example of foul magic he came across or devised.\n\nOther practitioners of evil have added their own input to the book's catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.\n\n{@skill Nature|XPHB} can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nWhenever a creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature makes a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a {@creature Larva|XMM} under the DM's control. Only a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell can reverse this vile transformation.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nAdjusted Ability Scores\n\nOne ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.\n\nTireless Form\n\nWhile the book is on your person, you have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the {@condition Exhaustion|XPHB} condition.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n\n3 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} property\n\n3 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} properties\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG|major detrimental} properties\n\nSpells\n\nWhile holding the book and holding it, you can cast the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it:\n\n{@spell Animate Dead|XPHB}\n\n{@spell Circle of Death|XPHB}\n\n{@spell Dominate Monster|XPHB}\n\n{@spell Finger of Death|XPHB}\n\nOnce you use the book to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nVile Lore\n\nYou can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on that check.\n\nAt the DM's discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.\n\nVile Speech\n\nWhile the book is on your person, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take {@damage 1d12} Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes {@damage 3d6} Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.\n\nDestroying the Book\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a {@creature solar|XMM} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice 1d100} years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms {@dice 1d10 × 100} years later.",

Whether Constantori's actual appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates.\n\nSentience\n\nConstantori's Portrait is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has {@sense darkvision} within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself.\n\nThe painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations.\n\nPersonality\n\nConstantori's Portrait is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame.\n\nWealth of Information\n\nThe painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, Constantori's Portrait has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore—everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't.\n\nWhile attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you, however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell).\n\nGuardian Portrait\n\nWhile you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends.\n\nThe painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast {@spell magic missile} (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nThe painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a {@spell mending} spell, it regains {@dice 2d6} hit points.",

    "item_description": "Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nSpells\n\nThe crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it: {@spell aura of life} (2 charges), {@spell aura of purity} (2 charges), {@spell banishment} (1 charge), {@spell beacon of hope} (1 charge), {@spell mass cure wounds} (3 charges). The crook regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nAbsolute Banishment\n\nWhile you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.\n\nFailing Matrix\n\nWhenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.\n\nIggwilv's Curse\n\nWhen the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\n\n\n\nDestroying or Repairing the Crook\n\nThe Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.",

The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\n\nThe lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe lantern has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nPrecious Fuel\n\nThe lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\n\nThe lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the \"Destroying the Lantern\" section).\n\nRevealing Light\n\nThe lantern sheds {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} in a 60-foot radius and {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}.\n\nWhile attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} radius.\n\nLenses\n\nWhen found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.\n\nAs an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save {@dc 20}) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.\n\n\n\nDestroying the Lantern\n\nTo destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.",

While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with {@item shortsword|phb|shortswords} or {@item longsword|phb|longswords}, you are proficient with Dawnbringer.\n\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} radiant damage.\n\nThe sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n\nWhile holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast {@spell lesser restoration} on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nSentience\n\nDawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it.\n\nPersonality\n\nForged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.\n\nLong years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.",

    "item_description": "Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)\n\nLike the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.\n\n\n\nAberration\n\nYou gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.\n\nBeast\n\nYou immediately transform into a {@filter random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&5]|type=beast}. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.\n\nYou remain transformed in this way for {@dice 2d12} days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the {@spell Wish} spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.\n\nBook\n\nYou gain the ability to speak, read, and write {@dice 1d6 + 2} languages of your choice.\n\nBridge\n\nYou gain the ability to cast the {@spell Time Stop} spell {@dice 1d3} times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nCampfire\n\nYou immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.\n\nCavern\n\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\n\nCelestial\n\nYou sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.\n\nConstruct\n\nA {@creature homunculus} appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\n\nCorpse\n\nYou immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the {@condition unconscious} condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the {@spell Wish} spell.\n\nCrossroads\n\nRoll a {@dice d20}. If the roll is even, you age {@dice 1d10} years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by {@dice 1d10} years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the {@spell Wish} spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nDoor\n\nYou gain the ability to cast the {@spell Gate} spell {@dice 1d4} times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nDragon\n\nA dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.\n\nElemental\n\nYou become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nExpert\n\nYour Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nFey\n\nA fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\n\nThe fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\n\nFiend\n\nA powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\n\nGiant\n\nYou immediately grow {@dice 2d10} inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\n\nHumanoid\n\nYou can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.\n\nLance\n\nAll your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\nMage\n\nYour Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nMap\n\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\n\nMaze\n\nYou gain {@dice 1d3} levels of {@condition exhaustion}.\n\nMine\n\nA pile of {@dice 2d6} gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and {@dice 1d10} chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\n\nMonstrosity\n\nA {@filter Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&10]|type=monstrosity|size=l;h;g} (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nOoze\n\nA {@creature gelatinous cube} immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nPath\n\nYour walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n\nPit\n\nA pit opens beneath you. You plummet {@damage 3d6 × 10} feet, take damage from the fall, and have the {@condition prone} condition.\n\nPlant\n\nYou gain the ability to cast {@spell Speak with Plants} without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nPriest\n\nYour Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nPrisoner\n\nGlowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the {@condition restrained} condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the {@spell Dispel Magic} spell or similar magic. However, a {@spell Disintegrate} spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a {@dc 30} Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}.\n\nRing\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer magic ring|items|source=|type=ring|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\n\nShield\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer suit of magic armor|items|source=|type=light armor;heavy armor;medium armor|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\n\nShip\n\nYou gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\n\nStaff\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand|items|source=|type=rod;wand;staff|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nStairway\n\nYou can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a {@filter rare or rarer wondrous item|items|source=|type=wondrous item|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=}, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nStatue\n\nYou immediately have the {@condition petrified} condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the {@spell Greater Restoration} spell or similar magic.\n\nTavern\n\nYour Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nTemple\n\nA deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the {@spell Resurrection} spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n\nTomb\n\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the {@spell True Resurrection} spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nTower\n\nDraw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n\nTree\n\nYour skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the {@spell Wish} spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nUndead\n\nSomewhere on the Material Plane, a {@creature revenant} rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a {@spell Wish} spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\n\nWarrior\n\nYour Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nWell\n\nYou learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.",

    "item_description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)\n\n\n\nEach card's effect is described below.\n\nBalance\n\nYou can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.\n\nComet\n\nThe next time you enter combat against one or more {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB}. If you reduce your foe to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} during that combat, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n\nDonjon\n\nYou disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\nEuryale\n\nThe card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n\nFates\n\nReality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\nFlames\n\nA powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nA Question of Enmity\n\nTwo of the cards in the Deck of Many Things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil.\n\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.\n\nFool\n\nYou have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.\n\nGem\n\nTwenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.\n\nJester\n\nYou have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nKey\n\nA Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nKnight\n\nYou gain the service of a {@creature Knight|XMM}, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n\nMoon\n\nYou gain the ability to cast {@spell Wish|XPHB} {@dice 1d3} times.\n\nPuzzle\n\nPermanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by {@dice 1d4 + 1} (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nRogue\n\nAn NPC of the DM's choice becomes {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nRuin\n\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|XDMG|7}), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nSage\n\nAt any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n\nSkull\n\nAn {@creature Avatar of Death|XDMG} appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.\n\nStar\n\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n\nSun\n\nA magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} daily at dawn until you die.\n\nTalons\n\nEvery magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n\nThrone\n\nYou gain proficiency and {@variantrule Expertise|XPHB} in your choice of {@skill History|XPHB}, {@skill Insight|XPHB}, {@skill Intimidation|XPHB}, or {@skill Persuasion|XPHB}. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\nVoid\n\nYour soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.",

    "item_description": "Stored in a leather pouch, this unique deck contains twenty-two colored cards made of some strong but unknown metal, each of which features a design printed as a mosaic of raised dots. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the {@card Fool|Deck of Several Things|LLK} or the {@card Jester|Deck of Several Things|LLK}, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n\n\nBalance\n\nYour mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change for the duration of the adventure. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\nComet\n\nIf you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you have advantage on ability checks made using one skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\nDonjon\n\nYou are instantly teleported to and confined within the prison of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M6). Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards.\n\nEuryale\n\nThe card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −1 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the adventure.\n\nThe Fates\n\nReality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other point during the adventure.\n\nFlames\n\nThe Grand Master of the Monastery of the Distressed Body becomes your enemy. The bone devil seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. If the Grand Master has already been defeated, you gain the enmity of {@creature Garret Levistusson|LLK|Garret Levistusson's} patron—a similarly powerful devil.\n\nFool\n\nFor the duration of the adventure, you lose proficiency with one skill or gain disadvantage on all checks made with one skill (with the skill and the penalty determined by the DM). Discard this card and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws.\n\nGem\n\nThe 1,000 gp hoard of the leprechaun from the Wilderness Encounters table (see appendix A) appears at your feet. If that treasure has already been claimed, you gain an equivalent hoard.\n\nIdiot\n\nReduce your Intelligence by {@dice 1d4 + 1} (to a minimum score of 1) for the duration of the adventure. You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nJester\n\nYou gain proficiency in a skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nKey\n\nA common or uncommon magic weapon with which you are proficient, or a {@item spell scroll} featuring a spell of a level you can cast, appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon or spell, which you possess for the duration of this adventure.\n\nKnight\n\nYou gain the service of any of the NPCs in the \"{@book Hirelings|phb|5|services}\" section not currently with the party, who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, believing that the fates have drawn them to you. You control this character.\n\nMoon\n\nYou are granted the ability to cast any spell of 5th level or lower, and can use that ability {@dice 1d3} times for the duration of the adventure.\n\nRogue\n\nAn NPC of the DM's choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nRuin\n\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure.\n\nSkull\n\nYou summon an avatar of death—a mechanical skeleton (use bone naga statistics) clad in a tattered black robe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\nStar\n\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 1 for the duration of the adventure. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\nSun\n\nYou gain proficiency in the skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. In addition, a common or uncommon wondrous item appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item, which you possess for the duration of this adventure.\n\nTalons\n\nEvery magic item you wear or carry is lost to you. These items can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure.\n\nThrone\n\nYou gain proficiency in the {@skill Persuasion} skill and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill for the duration of the adventure. In addition, the Monastery of the Distressed Body's brains in jars regard you thereafter as the monastery's rightful master. You must defeat or otherwise clear out the Grand Master and its servants before you can claim the monastery as yours.\n\nVizier\n\nAt any one time you choose within the duration of the adventure, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\nThe Void\n\nThis black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M8) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is {@condition incapacitated}. {@spell Divination}, {@spell contact other plane}, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.\n\nUsing the Deck of Several Things\n\nThe special nature of this deck (carried by {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK} if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7).\n\nFor cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time ({@card Donjon|Deck of Several Things|LLK} and {@card the Void|Deck of Several Things|LLK}), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed.",

Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nYou can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table.\n\n\n\nBeginning\n\nYour hit point maximum and current hit points increase by {@dice 2d10}. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours.\n\nChampion\n\nYou gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours.\n\nChancellor\n\nWithin 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast {@spell Augury} once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nChaos\n\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for {@dice 1d12} days.\n\nCoin\n\nFive pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet.\n\nCrown\n\nYou learn the {@spell Friends} cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect.\n\nDawn\n\nThis card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.\n\nDay\n\nYou gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\nDestiny\n\nThis card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.\n\nDusk\n\nThis card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nEnd\n\nThis card is an omen of death. You take {@damage 2d10} necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nIsolation\n\nYou disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for {@dice 1d4} minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.\n\nJustice\n\nYou momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a {@dice d20} with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n\nKnife\n\nAn uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nLock\n\nYou gain the ability to cast {@spell Knock} {@dice 1d3} times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nMischief\n\nYou receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nMonster\n\nThis card's monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll {@dice 1d4} and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nMystery\n\nYou have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.\n\nNight\n\nYou gain {@sense darkvision} within a range of 300 feet. This {@sense darkvision} lasts for 8 hours.\n\nOrder\n\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for {@dice 1d12} days.\n\nStudent\n\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).\n\nVulture\n\nOne nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.

    "item_description": "This treatise, composed by {@book Iggwilv|XDMG|8|Iggwilv} the archmage, documents the Abyss's layers and inhabitants and is widely regarded as the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.\n\nAbyssal Lore\n\nYou can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom ({@skill Survival|XPHB}) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the check.\n\nContainment\n\nThe first ten pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a {@spell Magic Circle|XPHB} spell. The Fiend must succeed on a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw with {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhen you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).\n\nWhen the tome is discovered, it has {@dice 1d4} Fiends occupying its pages—typically an assortment of demons.\n\nEnsnarement\n\nWhile carrying the book, whenever you cast {@spell Magic Circle|XPHB} naming only Fiends or cast {@spell Planar Binding|XPHB} targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on its saving throw against the spell.\n\nFiendish Scourging\n\nWhile carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Artifact has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG|major detrimental} property\n\nSpells\n\nThe book has 8 charges and regains {@dice 1d8} expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to cast one of the spells (save {@dc 20}) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\n\n\nDestroying the Demonomicon\n\nTo destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. The Tome of Zyx can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu knows instantly.",

Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.\n\nThose with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.\n\nWithin 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a {@dc 12} Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.\n\nFor any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence—because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily {@condition deafened} and must make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains {@condition deafened} for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.\n\nWhile the horn is sounding, a creature must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a {@dice d20} roll of 19 or 20.\n\nBlessing of the Wild\n\nIf you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:\n\nPiety 10+\n\nPiety 25+\n\nIf you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental} property.\n\nSee \"Artifacts\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.\n\nArrows of the Seasons\n\nThe four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:\n\nSpring\n\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the {@spell awaken} spell for 8 hours.\n\nSummer\n\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a {@creature tiger} with the {@book Nyxborn traits|MOT|6|Nyxborn Creatures} from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.\n\nAutumn\n\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the {@spell wall of thorns} spell there.\n\nWinter\n\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the {@spell ice storm} spell there.\n\nDestroying the Bow\n\nThe bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox.

Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.\n\nThe Eye of Vecna and the {@item Hand of Vecna|XDMG} are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.\n\nRandom Properties of the Eye and Hand\n\nThe Eye of Vecna has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} property\n\nAttuning to the Eye\n\nTo attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket.

You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save {@dc 18}). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a {@chance 5} chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.\n\n\n\nX-ray Vision\n\nYou can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand\n\nIf the Eye of Vecna and the {@item Hand of Vecna|XDMG} are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the {@item Sword of Kas|XDMG}, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed.

The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a {@item +1 Lance|XDMG}, and the other becomes a {@item +2 Longsword|XDMG}. Removing a horn requires a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from the goat must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The {@condition Frightened|XPHB} creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\nGoat of Traveling\n\nThis figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a {@creature Riding Horse|XMM}. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.\n\nGoat of Travail\n\nThis figurine can become a {@creature Giant Goat|XMM} for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.",

    "item_description": "{@creature Iggwilv the Witch Queen|WBtW|Iggwilv} crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n\nAttunement\n\nAny Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in {@dice 3d8} days. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\n\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nRegardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property (determined by rolling on the {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|Minor Beneficial} Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property (determined by rolling on the {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|Minor Detrimental} Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n\nGold Cauldron\n\nThe gold cauldron has the following properties:\n\nIf water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\n\nIf wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhen the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a {@spell scrying} spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\n\nDipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Cauldron\n\nThe iron cauldron has the following properties:\n\nYou can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a {@creature swarm of bats} that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIf at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being {@condition charmed}. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An {@condition unconscious} creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nTying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a {@item wand of polymorph} with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.\n\nIf you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is {@condition incapacitated}, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.\n\nDestroying the Cauldron\n\nThe cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\n\nThe destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual).\n\nReconstructing the Cauldron\n\nIf all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a {@spell wish} spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.\n\nThe Witch Queen's Cauldron\n\nAs explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:\n\nEight cats perch atop eight dead attending\n\nEight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging\n\nEight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling\n\nEight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming\n\nEight eyes open, always dreaming\n\nAll on the cauldron that is ever seeming",

Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.\n\nWhen an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.\n\nA creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a {@dc 30} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 ({@damage 12d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

    "item_description": "A keystone of creation is a piece of the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nA keystone of creation has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Beneficial Manifestations|AitFR-AVT|beneficial} manifestation\n\n1 {@table Detrimental Manifestations|AitFR-AVT|detrimental} manifestation\n\nExtradimensional Places\n\nYou can use the keystone to conjure an extradimensional space such as {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}. The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\"\n\nRaising Structures\n\nYou can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the {@spell mighty fortress|XGE} spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\" Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings.\n\nConnected Spaces\n\nYou can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once.\n\nDestroying a Keystone\n\nA keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.\n\nAfter it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over {@dice 1d12 + 1} days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over {@dice 1d20 + 10} minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.\n\nWhen a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT} is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.\n\nIf it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell), a keystone is destroyed.\n\nConstruction Details\n\nYou can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows.\n\nDemiplane Design\n\nWith a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be {@condition invisible}, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.\n\nEach square mile can include a single structure up to the size of {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.\n\nYou cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed.\n\nPhysical Structure Design\n\nWith a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.\n\nYou may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive {@skill Perception} score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm.\n\nManifestations\n\nEach place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured.",

    "item_description": "Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.\n\nCreated by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her {@deck tarokka deck|CoS}. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\n\nLike all {@deck Tarokka Deck|CoS|tarokka decks}, the {@i Tarokka of Souls} is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} properties\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n\nSpells\n\nWhile holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it: {@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell detect evil and good}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell locate object}, or {@spell scrying}. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nEnduring Vision\n\nWhile holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your {@status concentration} on divination spells.\n\nTwist of Fate\n\nAs an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:\n\nWeal\n\nWoe\n\nThe deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.\n\nPrisoners of Fate\n\nWhenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll {@dice d100} and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.\n\n\n\nThe released soul appears at a random location within {@dice 10d10} miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.\n\nShuffling Fate\n\nIf you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.\n\nDestroying the Deck\n\nLuba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a {@creature lich}, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal {@deck tarokka deck|CoS}, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.\n\nMother Luba and the Vistani\n\nThe creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\n\nA halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\n\nSome years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.",

The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it.

    "item_description": "Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the {@creature Mighty Servant of Leuk-o|TCE} is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.\n\nTales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the {@i Machine of Lum the Mad}. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the {@i Mind of Metal}, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\n\nDangerous Attunement\n\nTwo creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.\n\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\n\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a {@chance 25} chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\n\nControlling the Servant\n\nWhile any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful {@dc 25} Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}. A {@spell knock} spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\n\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\n\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\n\nOpen or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)\n\nMove the servant up to its speed (no action required)\n\nAs an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.\n\nWhen a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.\n\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\n\nGhost in the Machine\n\nUpon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.\n\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.\n\nSelf-Destruct\n\nBy inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\n\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 ({@damage 25d6}) force damage, 87 ({@damage 25d6}) lightning damage, and 87 ({@damage 25d6}) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\n\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, {@dice 2d6} days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\n\nDestroying the Servant\n\nThe servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.",

A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB}, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.\n\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet.

The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.\n\nIn a similar way, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n\nPlacing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item Bag of Holding|XDMG}, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other.

In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\n\nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\n\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\n\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\n\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically {@dice 1d6 + 1}). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.\n\n\n\nSentience\n\nA moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.\n\nPersonality\n\nEvery moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.\n\nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.\n\nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.",

Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a {@dice d10}. Once within the next hour, that character can add the {@dice d10} to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it's not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\nEldritch Occultant\n\nStarting at rank 2, your occultant abacus becomes an uncommon magic item that can track lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your occultant abacus within 5 feet of a creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the {@spell augury} spell. The course of action you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This property of the occultant abacus can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nBring Out Your Dead\n\nAlso at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest.\n\nBead of Instant Karma\n\nAt rank 3, one of the beads on your occultant abacus channels the power of instant karma, turning the occultant abacus into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn.\n\nBead of Diverted Karma\n\nAt rank 4, one of the beads on your occultant abacus allows you to divert karma to where it's needed, turning the occultant abacus into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a {@dice d10} to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the {@dice d10} to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn.\n\nCorrect the Balance\n\nAs a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature's death, you can use your occultant abacus to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world.\n\nIf you fail the check, this property of the occultant abacus can't be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can't be used again until dawn seven days later.",

    "item_description": "Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb's magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb's control.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are {@condition Charmed|XPHB} by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to it, and the orb casts {@spell Suggestion|XPHB} on you at will (save {@dc 18}), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of {@book Tiamat|XDMG|8|Tiamat}, or something else the DM decides.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nAn Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG|major detrimental} property\n\nSpells\n\nThe orb has 7 charges and regains {@dice 1d4 + 3} expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\n\n\nCall Dragons\n\nWhile you control the orb, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as {@book Tiamat|XDMG|8|Tiamat} are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\nDestroying an Orb\n\nAn Orb of Dragonkind has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a {@spell Disintegrate|XPHB} spell. Nothing else can harm it.",

    "item_description": "This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.\n\nThe Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.\n\nTo prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.\n\nRandom Properties. The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial properties}\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial property}\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental properties}\n\nThe random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.\n\nThe Sum of Its Parts\n\nEach of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:\n\nThe {@item chronolometer|AI}\n\nThe {@item dimensional loop|AI}\n\nThe {@item far gear|AI}\n\nThe {@item rotor of return|AI}\n\nThe {@item timepiece of travel|AI}\n\nThe {@item wheel of stars|AI}\n\nCreatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.\n\nWhile a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.\n\nFuture Echoes\n\nWith or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n\nInto the Void\n\nWith or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.\n\nMaster of Travel\n\nWhile all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 17}): {@spell contact other plane} (3 charges), {@spell demiplane} (6 charges), {@spell gate} (7 charges), {@spell plane shift} (5 charges), or {@spell teleportation circle} (3 charges).

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n\nYou can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\n\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a {@dc 10} Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nPlacing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item Bag of Holding|XDMG}, {@item Heward's Handy Haversack|XDMG}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other.

    "item_description": "{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.\n\nThe Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.\n\nNondetection\n\nThe Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\n\nFrozen Time\n\nAs long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a {@creature ghost}.\n\nCold Immunity\n\nWhile attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide).\n\nMagic\n\nThe Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:\n\nYou can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\n\nYou can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save {@dc 17}) by expending the necessary number of charges: {@spell Bigby's hand} (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), {@spell cone of cold} (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as {@spell flesh to stone} except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), {@spell ice storm} (2 charges), {@spell Otiluke's freezing sphere} (3 charges), {@spell sleet storm} (1 charge), {@spell spike growth} (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or {@spell wall of ice} (2 charges).\n\nYou can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: {@condition charmed}, {@condition exhaustion}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, {@condition petrified}, and {@condition poisoned}. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 ({@dice 1d10}) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.\n\nOther Properties\n\nThe Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a {@creature djinni} in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.\n\nDestroying the Ring\n\nThe ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.",

The flames shed {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 40-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra {@damage 2d6} Fire damage on a hit.\n\nButton 2\n\nThe rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nButton 3\n\nThe rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nButton 4\n\nThe rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nButton 5\n\nThe rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n\nButton 6\n\nThe rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\n\nDrain Life\n\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw.

A demon lord named {@creature Miska the Wolf-Spider|VEoR} eventually pushed the primordials' enemies to the brink of annihilation.\n\nDesperate to save themselves and their allies, powerful elemental beings called the Wind Dukes of Aaqa rose against Miska. Committed to the concept of law, the Wind Dukes descended from a people called the vaati, who once ruled many worlds. Seven Wind Dukes wove their power into an artifact called the Rod of Law. The dukes used the rod to imprison Miska on the plane of Pandemonium. As a result, the rod shattered into seven parts that were scattered throughout the multiverse. The rod thus became known as the Rod of Seven Parts.\n\nPossessing the Broken Rod\n\nThe rod can't be attuned to while it is broken. While holding one piece of the broken rod, you know the general location of the next consecutive piece, as the rod yearns to be a complete artifact. Multiple rod pieces can be assembled into one piece or disassembled again, each requiring an action, although a partially complete rod doesn't gain any other abilities.\n\nAdditionally, while holding one piece of the broken rod, you can use an action to cast the spell associated with that piece, as listed on the Rod Pieces table. Once that piece of the rod has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used that way again until the next dawn.\n\n\n\nPossessing the Whole Rod\n\nOnce all seven pieces are reassembled, a creature can attune to the Rod of Seven Parts. While attuned to the rod, you gain the following benefits:\n\nMagic Weapon\n\nThe Rod of Seven Parts functions for you as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nRod Spellcasting\n\nThe Rod of Seven Parts has 7 charges and regains {@dice 1d4 + 3} expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast any of the spells in the Rod Pieces table. You can also use an action to cast {@spell Detect Evil and Good} from the rod without using any charges.\n\nUltimate Law\n\nIf you are not of a lawful alignment, you find your worldview shifting toward keeping a personal code. You are more apt to keep your promises, follow through on your declarations, and adhere to your beliefs.\n\nDestroying the Rod\n\nThe only way to destroy the Rod of Seven Parts is to immerse the assembled rod in lava in the Abyss. It must remain in the lava for fifty years before it finally is consumed.\n\nA piece of the rod may be temporarily destroyed in this way, but each piece re-forms one year after it has succumbed.

It is a magic rod that functions as a morningstar and you have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. All damage dealt with it is converted to necrotic, and when you hit a good aligned creature, that creature takes an extra {@damage 2d12} necrotic damage.\n\nThe Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has 66 charges and regains {@dice 6d6} charges each nightfall. Asmodeus is always capable of perceiving through the rod and knows the exact location of any creature attuned to it. If a creature uses the special abilities of the rod without Asmodeus's permission, they take {@damage 2d12} necrotic damage each use, doubled if they're good aligned. This damage ignores resistances and immunities, and if it kills the user, Asmodeus permanently claims their soul.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental} properties\n\nAsmodeus is immune to the detrimental properties of the weapon.\n\nBow to the King\n\nYou may use an action to expend 33 charges to use the rod to force all creatures within a 150-foot-radius to bow to you. A creature must succeed on a {@dc 21} Charisma saving throw or be forced to kneel for up to 1 hour. Creatures immune to the {@condition charmed} condition have advantage on their save. Each time a kneeling creature takes damage, they may repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends early for kneeling creatures if they're touched by the Ruby Rod.\n\nAcid, Cold, and Lightning\n\nAt a cost of 9 charges each use, you may use an action to trigger one of the following effects:\n\nYou project acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 12d8} acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nYou project an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 12d8} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nYou shoot lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 12d10} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nReactions\n\nAs a reaction to suffering a detrimental effect, you may cast {@spell Lesser Restoration} (expending 3 charges) or {@spell Greater Restoration} (expending 12 charges.)\n\nAdditionally, if you're the sole target of a spell, you may use a reaction to attempt to use the rod to absorb the spell and cancel its effect. You roll {@dice 1d20 + 2}, and if the result is higher than the spell level + 10, the spell is absorbed into the rod. The rod regains charges equal to the spell level it absorbed. If the absorbed charges go over the maximum of 66 charges, it overloads, dealing {@damage 1d6} necrotic damage per charge to you and expending all charges.\n\nDestroying the Rod\n\nWhile Asmodeus lives, the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus can't be destroyed, and if attempted it simply returns to Asmodeus. If he were defeated, the rod could be destroyed by bringing it to the Abyss from whence it was created, then performing a ritual known only to Asmodeus.",

    "item_description": "The Shield of the Hidden Lord is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.\n\nWhile holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:\n\nThe shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and {@sense truesight} out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.\n\nThe shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast {@spell fireball} or 2 charges to cast {@spell wall of fire} from the shield (save {@dc 21} for each). The {@spell wall of fire} spell lasts for 1 minute (no {@status concentration} required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nAnytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition frightened} until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn.\n\nGargauth's Personality\n\nGargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.\n\nWhile trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.\n\nGargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.\n\nFreeing Gargauth\n\nCasting {@spell dispel evil and good} on the shield has a {@chance 1} chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a {@creature solar}, a {@creature planetar}, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.",

Because each Soul Coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.\n\nCarrying Soul Coins\n\nTo hold a Soul Coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.\n\nAn evil creature can carry as many Soul Coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of Soul Coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of Soul Coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\n\nUsing a Soul Coin\n\nA Soul Coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a Soul Coin and use it to do one of the following:\n\nDrain Life\n\nYou siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain {@dice 1d10} temporary hit points.\n\nQuery\n\nYou telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\nFreeing a Soul\n\nCasting a spell that removes a curse on a Soul Coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served, or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from Soul Coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\n\nA soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A Soul Coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by an infernal warship's furnace.\n\nFreeing a soul from a Soul Coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\n\nHellish Currency\n\nSoul Coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.\n\nSoul Coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.",

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A {@spell greater restoration}, {@spell remove curse}, or similar spell ends the curse on the target.\n\nThe Forgotten One\n\nThe bodiless life force of a dead {@creature archmage} empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects {@creature Acererak|ToA} from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than {@creature Acererak|ToA} expends any of the staff's charges, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a {@spell dispel evil and good} spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead {@creature archmage} attempts to destroy the staff.\n\nDestroying the Staff\n\nA creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 ({@damage 24d10}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess.",

While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the {@spell legend lore} spell.\n\nBy using the stone to cast {@spell legend lore}, you communicate directly with the {@creature aboleth}, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\n\nThe aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.\n\nFailed Memory\n\nWhen your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A {@spell remove curse} spell cast on you has a {@chance 20} chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a {@spell greater restoration} spell does so automatically.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the {@creature aboleth} learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\nPersonality\n\nThe Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n\nDestroying the Stone\n\nWhile in stone form, the {@creature aboleth} isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.",

The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind.\n\nBloodthirst\n\nThe sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn't taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes {@damage 3d6} Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the {@spell Dominate Monster|XPHB} spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.\n\nMagic Weapon\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a {@variantrule Critical Hit|XPHB} on a roll of 19 or 20 on the {@dice d20} and deals an extra {@damage 2d10} Slashing damage to Undead.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe sword has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} property\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG|major detrimental} property\n\nSpells\n\nWhile the sword is on your person, you can cast the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it:\n\n{@spell Call Lightning|XPHB}\n\n{@spell Divine Word|XPHB}\n\n{@spell Finger of Death|XPHB}\n\nOnce you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nSpirit of Kas\n\nWhile the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:\n\nBattle Hunger\n\nYou add {@dice 1d10} to your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} rolls.\n\nBlade of Defense\n\nWhen you take an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB} instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.\n\nNecrotic Resistance\n\nYou have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Necrotic damage.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Sword of Kas is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.\n\nPersonality\n\nThe sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\n\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the {@item Eye and Hand of Vecna|XDMG}.\n\nDestroying the Sword\n\nA creature attuned to both the {@item Eye of Vecna|XDMG} and the {@item Hand of Vecna|XDMG} can use the {@spell Wish|XPHB} property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell's caster.

The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can't. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism.\n\nAttunement\n\nThe sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. Your alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:\n\nAngelic Language\n\nCelestial Resistance\n\nDivine Presence\n\nFeathered Wings\n\nTruesight\n\nNew Personality\n\nYou gain new personality traits, determined by rolling once on each of the following tables. These traits override any conflicting personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly Light\n\nThe sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon's radius of bright light.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe sword has 2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial properties}.\n\nSearing Radiance\n\nThe sword deals an extra 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 ({@damage 3d10}) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the end of its next turn.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.\n\nThe sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.\n\nTruth Seer\n\nWhile holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) checks.\n\nDestroying the Sword\n\nZariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see \"{@adventure Shattering the Companion|BGDIA|8|shattering the companion}\"), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.\n\nIf Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.",

Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created.

Then roll another {@dice d20}. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM.

    "item_description": "This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.\n\nExplorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\n\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\n\nSilver Wire\n\nThe Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\n\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\n\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires {@status concentration} can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.\n\nSummon Monster\n\nWhen first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\n\n1/day: {@spell conjure animals}, {@spell summon lesser demons|XGE}\n\n1/7 days: {@spell conjure minor elementals}, {@spell conjure woodland beings}, {@spell summon greater demon|XGE}\n\n1/month: {@spell conjure elemental}, {@spell conjure fey}\n\nWish\n\nThe Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative {@chance 10} chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThere are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\n\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.\n\n(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\n\nDestroying the Machine\n\nThe Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.",

They exemplify his time spent in the glacier, augmenting telepathy, divination, and defense. Due to his control over ice, Levistus can conjure the True-Ice Shards from anywhere, including if they were destroyed.\n\nWhen using the magic dagger, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC, as long as it is used as your offhand weapon, and it does {@damage 1d6} cold damage instead of its regular damage.\n\nBecause Levistus conjures the True-Ice Shards at will, he often rewards a copy of the artifact to his most loyal followers. The copies are identical to the original with one exception: Levistus can destroy or retrieve a copy at any time.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe True-Ice Shards have the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} properties\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental} property\n\nSub-Zero\n\nCold damage dealt with the shards ignores resistances and immunities. Creatures vulnerable to cold damage take triple damage from the True-Ice Shards, rather than double.\n\nAfter you damage a creature with the shards, you may use a bonus action to force the creature to make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature that took the damage becomes vulnerable to cold damage for 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until after you have finished a long rest.\n\nMental Command\n\nWhile attuned to the True-Ice Shards, you can use an action to cast the {@spell Detect Thoughts} spell (save {@dc 20}), targeting any creature you have previously met. If the targeted creature is on a different plane of existence, the spell fails.\n\nAs long as you maintain {@status concentration}, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to the focused creature. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—as long as the focus and {@status concentration} continue.\n\nOmniscient\n\nYou can use the True-Ice Shards to cast a variety of divination spells. {@spell Locate Animals or Plants}, {@spell Locate Creature}, and {@spell Locate Object} may be cast at will, and don't have a maximum range. Other limitations of the spells still apply, and they can't detect subjects on other planes of existence.\n\nAdditionally, you may cast {@spell Scrying} (with a spell save DC of 20) and {@spell Find the Path}. Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again.\n\nDestroying the Shards\n\nWhile Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will.

The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user.

The wand deals an extra {@damage 2d12} Necrotic damage on a hit.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG|minor beneficial} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG|major beneficial} property\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG|minor detrimental} properties\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG|major detrimental} property\n\nThe detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus.\n\nProtection\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB} while holding the wand.\n\nSpells\n\nThe wand has 7 charges and regains {@dice 1d4 + 3} expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save {@dc 18}). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\n\n\nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).\n\nCall Undead\n\nWhile holding the wand, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to conjure 15 {@creature Skeleton|XMM|Skeletons} and 15 {@creature Zombie|XMM|Zombies}. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don't perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.\n\nSentience\n\nThe Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} out to 120 feet.\n\nThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.\n\nPersonality\n\nThe wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.\n\nTo further Orcus's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.\n\nDestroying the Wand\n\nDestroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\n\nBathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",

It embodies his ideals, representing defense, authority, and power. Its construction changes hourly, similar to the tower, appearing as either iron, steel, lead, or adamantine.\n\nThe Wrought-Iron Tower is a magic staff that functions as a warhammer and you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If a creature is vulnerable to a certain type of damage, all damage dealt with the staff is converted to that damage type. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra {@damage 3d6} fire damage.\n\nWhile holding the staff, you can control and navigate through the Iron Tower in Dis. While the staff is on the layer of Dis, Dispater knows the exact location of it, and is capable of teleporting to within 30 feet of it at will.\n\nRandom Properties\n\nThe Wrought-Iron Tower has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties.\n\nThe Best Offense\n\nWhile attuned to the staff, you have a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to all saving throws.\n\nAdditionally, the staff has 10 charges. When you make an attack, you may spend 1 or more charges. For each charge spent, you deal an additional 2 fire damage on a successful attack. Charges are still consumed if the attack misses. The staff regains all charges each day at dawn.\n\nAfter dealing damage with the staff, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to replace the damage dealt with your total AC instead.\n\nRulership\n\nThe Wrought-Iron Tower also functions as a {@item Rod of Rulership}, with an increased save DC of 18. This property costs 3 charges to use, though a creature that successfully saves against one of its uses is immune to future uses for 24 hours.\n\nSlag\n\nYou can cast {@spell Searing Smite} at 6th level on yourself, expending 1 charge.

The spell requires no {@status concentration} and lasts for 1 minute.\n\nDestroying the Staff\n\nThe Wrought-Iron Tower can only be destroyed inside the Iron Tower on Dis. Located somewhere within the tower is the forge that Dispater used to create the staff. An attuned creature must place the staff into the forge fires, then cast {@spell Dispel Evil and Good} and touch the staff. They then take {@damage 20d10} fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunities. If the attuned creature survives the fire damage, the staff is destroyed.",

The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.\n\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the {@creature storm giant} Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.\n\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is {@condition paralyzed} and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains {@condition paralyzed} until it is separated from the throne.\n\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.\n\nProperties of the Throne\n\nThe throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:\n\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell lightning bolt} (spell save {@dc 19}) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 ({@damage 14d6}) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the {@spell globe of invulnerability} spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an {@creature ancient blue dragon} that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an {@creature ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's} bite and claw attacks.\n\nDestroying the Throne\n\nThe Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@damage 20d6}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.\n\nThe Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.\n\nAll creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:\n\nWhile you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.\n\nAs an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.\n\nYou can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the {@spell control weather} spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.\n\nTouching the Mythallar\n\nAny creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw, taking 180 ({@damage 20d10 + 70}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
