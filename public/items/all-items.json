You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC.\n\nThe Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:\n\n[object Object]\n\nOne section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.\n\nWhen the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from {@spell True Resurrection}. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse.\n\nThe tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer {@damage 6d6} necrotic damage.\n\nThe spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll ({@dice 1d4 - 1}). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would.\n\nDestroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.\n\nThe second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.","loreFull":"The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood.","loreShort":"The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood.","rulesShort":"This is a magic tome that functions as a spellbook and arcane focus.

With them, he forged the {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}.\n\nArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\n\nLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n\nThe {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords} is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell remove curse} spell.\n\nThe only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, where it was created.

The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB}, and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\n\nAs an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\n\nIf you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.\n\nYou don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\n\nWhen you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\n\nThe mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the {@i Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga} or by Baba Yaga herself.","loreFull":"The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic.

A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a {@spell wish} spell.\n\nWhen it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum.

It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.\n\nDespite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to {@item Wave} and {@item Whelm}, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with {@item Whelm} and finds {@item Wave} tedious.\n\nBlackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed.

The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a {@chance 50} chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw.

You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n\nYou can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast {@spell dispel magic} on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n\nThis property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n\nWhen you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n\nThe Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18.

Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\n\nIn the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n\nWhen the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\n\nDestroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.","loreFull":"The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins.

Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes {@damage 24d6} radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n\n[object Object]\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\nOnce you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\nOnce you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.\n\nIt is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for {@dice 1d100} years.","loreFull":"The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions.

He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.\n\nOther practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.\n\nNature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.\n\nWhenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n\n[object Object]\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.\n\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the {@spell dominate monster} spell on an evil target (save {@dc 18}). You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nYou can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.\n\nWhile you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take {@damage 1d12} psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a {@creature solar} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice 1d100} years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms {@dice 1d10 × 100} years later.\n\nIf all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.","loreFull":"The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall.

This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\n\n[object Object]\n\nThe Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day.

The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest.

While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.\n\n[object Object]\n\nYou gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.\n\nYou immediately transform into a {@filter random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&5]|type=beast}. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.\n\nYou remain transformed in this way for {@dice 2d12} days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the {@spell Wish} spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.\n\nYou gain the ability to speak, read, and write {@dice 1d6 + 2} languages of your choice.\n\nYou gain the ability to cast the {@spell Time Stop} spell {@dice 1d3} times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nYou immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.\n\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\n\nYou sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.\n\nA {@creature homunculus} appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\n\nYou immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the {@condition unconscious} condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the {@spell Wish} spell.\n\nRoll a {@dice d20}. If the roll is even, you age {@dice 1d10} years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by {@dice 1d10} years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the {@spell Wish} spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nYou gain the ability to cast the {@spell Gate} spell {@dice 1d4} times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nA dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.\n\nYou become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nYour Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nA fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\n\nThe fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\n\nA powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\n\nYou immediately grow {@dice 2d10} inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\n\nYou can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.\n\nAll your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\nYour Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\n\nYou gain {@dice 1d3} levels of {@condition exhaustion}.\n\nA pile of {@dice 2d6} gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and {@dice 1d10} chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\n\nA {@filter Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&10]|type=monstrosity|size=l;h;g} (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nA {@creature gelatinous cube} immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nYour walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n\nA pit opens beneath you. You plummet {@damage 3d6 × 10} feet, take damage from the fall, and have the {@condition prone} condition.\n\nYou gain the ability to cast {@spell Speak with Plants} without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nYour Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nGlowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the {@condition restrained} condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the {@spell Dispel Magic} spell or similar magic. However, a {@spell Disintegrate} spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a {@dc 30} Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}.\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer magic ring|items|source=|type=ring|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer suit of magic armor|items|source=|type=light armor;heavy armor;medium armor|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\n\nYou gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\n\nA {@filter rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand|items|source=|type=rod;wand;staff|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nYou can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a {@filter rare or rarer wondrous item|items|source=|type=wondrous item|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=}, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nYou immediately have the {@condition petrified} condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the {@spell Greater Restoration} spell or similar magic.\n\nYour Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nA deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the {@spell Resurrection} spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the {@spell True Resurrection} spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nDraw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n\nYour skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the {@spell Wish} spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nSomewhere on the Material Plane, a {@creature revenant} rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a {@spell Wish} spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\n\nYour Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nYou learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.","loreFull":"Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it.

The bone devil seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. If the Grand Master has already been defeated, you gain the enmity of {@creature Garret Levistusson|LLK|Garret Levistusson's} patron—a similarly powerful devil.\n\nFor the duration of the adventure, you lose proficiency with one skill or gain disadvantage on all checks made with one skill (with the skill and the penalty determined by the DM). Discard this card and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws.\n\nThe 1,000 gp hoard of the leprechaun from the Wilderness Encounters table (see appendix A) appears at your feet.

The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, believing that the fates have drawn them to you. You control this character.\n\nYou are granted the ability to cast any spell of 5th level or lower, and can use that ability {@dice 1d3} times for the duration of the adventure.\n\nAn NPC of the DM's choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure.\n\nYou summon an avatar of death—a mechanical skeleton (use bone naga statistics) clad in a tattered black robe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 1 for the duration of the adventure. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\nYou gain proficiency in the skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure.

These items can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure.\n\nYou gain proficiency in the {@skill Persuasion} skill and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill for the duration of the adventure. In addition, the Monastery of the Distressed Body's brains in jars regard you thereafter as the monastery's rightful master. You must defeat or otherwise clear out the Grand Master and its servants before you can claim the monastery as yours.\n\nAt any one time you choose within the duration of the adventure, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\nThis black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M8) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is {@condition incapacitated}. {@spell Divination}, {@spell contact other plane}, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.\n\nThe special nature of this deck (carried by {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK} if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7).\n\nFor cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time ({@card Donjon|Deck of Several Things|LLK} and {@card the Void|Deck of Several Things|LLK}), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed.","loreFull":"Stored in a leather pouch, this unique deck contains twenty-two colored cards made of some strong but unknown metal, each of which features a design printed as a mosaic of raised dots.

For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.\n\nYou gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\nThis card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.\n\nThis card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nThis card is an omen of death. You take {@damage 2d10} necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nYou disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for {@dice 1d4} minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.\n\nYou momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a {@dice d20} with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n\nAn uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands.

While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll {@dice 1d4} and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a {@spell Remove Curse} spell or similar magic.\n\nYou have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.\n\nYou gain {@sense darkvision} within a range of 300 feet. This {@sense darkvision} lasts for 8 hours.\n\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for {@dice 1d12} days.\n\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).\n\nOne nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If the item isn't recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever.","loreFull":"Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it.

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\n\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\n\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.

The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\"\n\nYou can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the {@spell mighty fortress|XGE} spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\" Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings.\n\nYou can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once.\n\nA keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.\n\nAfter it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over {@dice 1d12 + 1} days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over {@dice 1d20 + 10} minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.\n\nWhen a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT} is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.\n\nIf it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell), a keystone is destroyed.\n\nYou can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows.\n\nWith a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be {@condition invisible}, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.\n\nEach square mile can include a single structure up to the size of {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.\n\nYou cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed.\n\nWith a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.\n\nYou may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive {@skill Perception} score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm.\n\nEach place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured.","loreFull":"A keystone of creation is a piece of the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}.","loreShort":"A keystone of creation is a piece of the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT}.","rulesShort":"A keystone of creation has the following random properties:\n[object Object]\nYou can use the keystone to conjure an extradimensional space such as {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}.

The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her {@deck tarokka deck|CoS}. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\n\nLike all {@deck Tarokka Deck|CoS|tarokka decks}, the {@i Tarokka of Souls} is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.\n\nThe artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n[object Object]\n\nWhile holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it: {@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell detect evil and good}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell locate object}, or {@spell scrying}. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nWhile holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your {@status concentration} on divination spells.\n\nAs an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:\n\n[object Object]\n\nThe deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.\n\nWhenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll {@dice d100} and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.\n\n[object Object]\n\nThe released soul appears at a random location within {@dice 10d10} miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.\n\nIf you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.\n\nLuba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a {@creature lich}, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal {@deck tarokka deck|CoS}, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.\n\nThe creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\n\nA halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\n\nSome years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.","loreFull":"Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter.

The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the {@i Mind of Metal}, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\n\nTwo creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.\n\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\n\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a {@chance 25} chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\n\nWhile any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful {@dc 25} Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}. A {@spell knock} spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\n\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\n\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\n\n[object Object]\n\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\n\nUpon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.\n\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.\n\nBy inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\n\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 ({@damage 25d6}) force damage, 87 ({@damage 25d6}) lightning damage, and 87 ({@damage 25d6}) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\n\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, {@dice 2d6} days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\n\nThe servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.","loreFull":"Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the {@creature Mighty Servant of Leuk-o|TCE} is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted.

She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.\n\nTo prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.\n\nRandom Properties.

If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.\n\nWhile a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.\n\nWith or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n\nWith or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.\n\nWhile all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges.

Treat the armor as a {@creature shield guardian} that has stored a {@spell magic missile} spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached.\n\nWhen donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a {@dc 13} Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies.\n\nFreeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time.\n\nWhenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control.\n\nPowered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities.","loreFull":"Powered armor resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material.

The original, complete Stone of Creation took the form of a blocky slab like a standing stone, but it may be impossible to know the Stone's true size, or if the concept of a \"whole\" Stone of Creation even applies to the artifact. Perhaps other slabs and boulders made from the Stone have been scattered across the multiverse, being cut down and recombed through interplanar movements and the magic of the artifacts themselves.\n\nThe Stone of Creation has the following random properties:\n\n[object Object]\n\nWhile attuned to the Stone of Creation, you are proficient with {@item mason's tools|PHB} and can use them to cut pieces from the Stone's slab, thereby creating lesser artifacts.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is a source for smaller artifacts that derive their power from it. These pieces allow you to shape and bestow a portion of the slab's power for yourself or others.\n\nYou can cut pieces in two general sizes: a {@item chip of creation|AitFR-AVT} or a {@item keystone of creation|AitFR-AVT}. These lesser artifacts require their own attunement.\n\nUp to eleven chips of creation can be created from the existing slab, plus up to nine keystones. A chip resembles a flake of rock about the size of an adult human's hand. A keystone is at least five times that thickness.\n\nWhen all chips and keystones have been cut away, a portion of the Stone remains but proves impervious to additional attempts to cut or chisel pieces from it. This smallest version of the Stone is the same size as a Tiny creature.\n\nAlthough the Stone of Creation cannot create structures or demiplanes of its own, while you are attuned to it you can revise or renovate any structure or demiplane created by a keystone or chip, provided you are within 1 mile of the Stone and you can see or otherwise perceive the structure or demiplane. For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur. These changes cannot deal damage or directly harm a creature. A dispelled structure gradually recedes and diminishes to nothing, leaving creatures unharmed.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is a strange artifact that can be divided into smaller artifacts, yet the Stone is impervious to most damage. Only the smith attuned to the Stone can carve it. Destroying the Stone's lesser, derived artifacts (and their creations) does no damage to the Stone itself.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is destroyed if it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck with a forked metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell). The Stone then shatters into harmless, inert shards of rock. Places created by the slab's chips and keystones crumble, decay, or fade away to nothing after the Stone of Creation is destroyed.

While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the {@spell legend lore} spell.\n\nBy using the stone to cast {@spell legend lore}, you communicate directly with the {@creature aboleth}, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\n\nThe aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.\n\nWhen your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A {@spell remove curse} spell cast on you has a {@chance 20} chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a {@spell greater restoration} spell does so automatically.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the {@creature aboleth} learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\nThe Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n\nWhile in stone form, the {@creature aboleth} isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.","loreFull":"The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand.

Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.\n\nThe Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra {@damage 2d10} slashing damage to undead.\n\nIf the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the {@spell dominate monster} spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.\n\nThe Sword of Kas has the following random properties:\n\n[object Object]\n\nWhile the sword is on your person, you add a {@dice d10} to your initiative at the start of every combat.

Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nThe Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.\n\nThe sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the {@creature lich||lich's} works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\n\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and {@item Hand of Vecna}. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.\n\nA creature attuned to both the {@item Eye of Vecna} and the {@item Hand of Vecna} can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the {@spell wish} spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails.

In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\n\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\n\nThe Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\n\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\n\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires {@status concentration} can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.\n\nWhen first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\n\n[object Object]\n\nThe Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative {@chance 10} chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\n\nThere are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\n\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.\n\n(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\n\nThe Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.\n\n[object Object]","loreFull":"This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today.

When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} bludgeoning damage, or an extra {@damage 2d8} bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.\n\nYou can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact.

Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a {@creature vampire}.

A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the {@creature storm giant} Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.\n\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is {@condition paralyzed} and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains {@condition paralyzed} until it is separated from the throne.\n\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.\n\nThe throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:\n\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell lightning bolt} (spell save {@dc 19}) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 ({@damage 14d6}) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the {@spell globe of invulnerability} spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an {@creature ancient blue dragon} that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an {@creature ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's} bite and claw attacks.\n\nThe Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions.
