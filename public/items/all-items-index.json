You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC.\n\nThe Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental} property\n\nOne section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a {@dc 22} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.\n\nWhen the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from {@spell True Resurrection}. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse.\n\nThe tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer {@damage 6d6} necrotic damage.\n\nThe spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll ({@dice 1d4 - 1}). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would.\n\nDestroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.\n\nThe second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"acid":{"name":"Acid","source":"XPHB","type":"G|XPHB","rarity":"none","description":"When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a vial of Acid.

Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.\n\nThis artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nThe mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.\n\nThe pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nThe pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nWhile holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB}, and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\n\nAs an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\n\nIf you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.\n\nYou don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\n\nWhen you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\n\nThe mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the {@i Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga} or by Baba Yaga herself.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"baba yaga's pestle":{"name":"Baba Yaga's Pestle","source":"TCE","type":"Melee Weapon","rarity":"artifact","description":"The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool.

Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n\nWhen you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n\nThe Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n\nThe staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\n\nIn the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n\nWhen the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\n\nDestroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":"by the Blackstaff heir, who must be a wizard","img":null},"blade of avernus":{"name":"Blade of Avernus","source":"BGDIA","type":"Melee Weapon","rarity":"artifact","description":"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.\n\nThe artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nThe crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it: {@spell aura of life} (2 charges), {@spell aura of purity} (2 charges), {@spell banishment} (1 charge), {@spell beacon of hope} (1 charge), {@spell mass cure wounds} (3 charges). The crook regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.\n\nWhenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.\n\nWhen the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\n\nd100 | Effect\n1-25 | A portal to a random plane opens.

One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"crossbow bolt":{"name":"Crossbow Bolt","source":"PHB","type":"Armor","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":"5 gp","weight":"0.075 lb.","slot":null,"img":null},"crossbow bolt case":{"name":"Crossbow Bolt Case","source":"XPHB","type":"G|XPHB","rarity":"none","description":"A {@item Crossbow Bolt Case|XPHB} holds up to 20 Bolts.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"crossbow bolts (20)":{"name":"Crossbow Bolts (20)","source":"PHB","type":"Armor","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":"100 gp","weight":"1.5 lb.","slot":null,"img":null},"crowbar":{"name":"Crowbar","source":"XPHB","type":"G|XPHB","rarity":"none","description":"Using a Crowbar gives you {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Strength checks where the Crowbar's leverage can be applied.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"crown of lies":{"name":"Crown of Lies","source":"VEoR","type":"Wondrous Item","rarity":"artifact","description":"After betraying and nearly destroying the lich Vecna, the warrior Kas found himself trapped in the Shadowfell, imprisoned in a Domain of Dread called Tovag.

Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\n\nThe lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.\n\nThe lantern has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property\n\nThe lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\n\nThe lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the \"Destroying the Lantern\" section).\n\nThe lantern sheds {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} in a 60-foot radius and {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}.\n\nWhile attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} radius.\n\nWhen found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.\n\nAs an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save {@dc 20}) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.\n\nLens Color | Spell | Fuel Cost\nAmethyst | {@spell Reverse Gravity} | 3,000 gp\nDiamond | {@spell Disintegrate} | 2,000 gp\nEmerald | {@spell Haste} | 500 gp\nJacinth | {@spell Flame Strike} | 1,000 gp\nRuby | {@spell Hold Monster} | 1,000 gp\nSapphire | {@spell Fear} | 500 gp\nTopaz | {@spell Slow} | 500 gp\nAny four colors | {@spell Prismatic Wall} | 5,000 gp\n\nTo destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"dark shard amulet":{"name":"Dark Shard Amulet","source":"XGE","type":"Wondrous Item","rarity":"common","description":"This amulet is fashioned from a single shard of resilient extraplanar material originating from the realm of your warlock patron.

While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire.

At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the {@spell Resurrection} spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the {@spell True Resurrection} spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nDraw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n\nYour skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage.

Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)\n\n{@dice 1d100} (13-Card Deck) | {@dice 1d100} (22-Card Deck) | Card\n— | 01-05 | Balance\n— | 06-10 | Comet\n— | 11-14 | Donjon\n01-08 | 15-18 | Euryale\n— | 19-23 | Fates\n09-16 | 24-27 | Flames\n— | 28-31 | Fool\n— | 32-36 | Gem\n17-24 | 37-41 | Jester\n25-32 | 42-46 | Key\n33-40 | 47-51 | Knight\n41-48 | 52-56 | Moon\n— | 57-60 | Puzzle\n49-56 | 61-64 | Rogue\n57-64 | 65-68 | Ruin\n— | 69-73 | Sage\n65-72 | 74-77 | Skull\n73-80 | 78-82 | Star\n81-88 | 83-87 | Sun\n— | 88-91 | Talons\n89-96 | 92-96 | Throne\n97-00 | 97-00 | Void\n\nEach card's effect is described below.\n\nYou can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2.

If you reduce your foe to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} during that combat, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n\nYou disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\nThe card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n\nReality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\nA powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nTwo of the cards in the Deck of Many Things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil.\n\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.\n\nYou have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests} for the next 72 hours.

The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nYou gain the service of a {@creature Knight|XMM}, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n\nYou gain the ability to cast {@spell Wish|XPHB} {@dice 1d3} times.\n\nPermanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by {@dice 1d4 + 1} (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nAn NPC of the DM's choice becomes {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|XDMG|7}), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nAt any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n\nAn {@creature Avatar of Death|XDMG} appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.\n\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n\nA magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} daily at dawn until you die.\n\nEvery magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n\nYou gain proficiency and {@variantrule Expertise|XPHB} in your choice of {@skill History|XPHB}, {@skill Insight|XPHB}, {@skill Intimidation|XPHB}, or {@skill Persuasion|XPHB}. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\nYour soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A {@spell Wish|XPHB} spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul.

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\n\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\n\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\n\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.

Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:\n\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the {@spell awaken} spell for 8 hours.\nAs an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required.

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\n\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\n\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\n\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\n\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\n\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold 5-zino coin":{"name":"Gold 5-Zino Coin","source":"GGR","type":"$C","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold bar (5-pound)":{"name":"Gold Bar (5-pound)","source":"XDMG","type":"TB|XDMG","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold basin with rubies (legion of dusk)":{"name":"Gold basin with rubies (Legion of Dusk)","source":"PSX","type":"$A|DMG","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold bird cage with electrum filigree":{"name":"Gold bird cage with electrum filigree","source":"DMG","type":"$A|DMG","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold birdcage with electrum filigree":{"name":"Gold birdcage with electrum filigree","source":"XDMG","type":"$A|XDMG","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold bracelet":{"name":"Gold bracelet","source":"XDMG","type":"$A|XDMG","rarity":"none","description":"","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"gold canary figurine of wondrous power":{"name":"Gold Canary Figurine of Wondrous Power","source":"FTD","type":"Wondrous Item","rarity":"legendary","description":"This gold statuette is carved in the likeness of a canary and is small enough to fit in a pocket.

The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n\nAny Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in {@dice 3d8} days. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\n\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\n\nRegardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:\n\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property (determined by rolling on the {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|Minor Beneficial} Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property (determined by rolling on the {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|Minor Detrimental} Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\n\nThe gold cauldron has the following properties:\n\nIf water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\nIf wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\nWhen the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a {@spell scrying} spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\nDipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nThe iron cauldron has the following properties:\n\nYou can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a {@creature swarm of bats} that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\nIf at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being {@condition charmed}. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An {@condition unconscious} creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\nTying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a {@item wand of polymorph} with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.\nIf you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is {@condition incapacitated}, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.\n\nThe cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\n\nThe destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual).\n\nIf all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a {@spell wish} spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties.

The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\"\n\nYou can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the {@spell mighty fortress|XGE} spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see \"Construction Details.\" Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings.\n\nYou can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once.\n\nA keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.\n\nAfter it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over {@dice 1d12 + 1} days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over {@dice 1d20 + 10} minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.\n\nWhen a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT} is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.\n\nIf it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell), a keystone is destroyed.\n\nYou can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows.\n\nWith a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be {@condition invisible}, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.\n\nEach square mile can include a single structure up to the size of {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.\n\nYou cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed.\n\nWith a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.\n\nYou may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive {@skill Perception} score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm.\n\nEach place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"khrusor, spear of heliod":{"name":"Khrusor, Spear of Heliod","source":"MOT","type":"Melee Weapon","rarity":"artifact","description":"Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun.

The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her {@deck tarokka deck|CoS}. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\n\nLike all {@deck Tarokka Deck|CoS|tarokka decks}, the {@i Tarokka of Souls} is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.\n\nThe artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} properties\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n\nWhile holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 18}) from it: {@spell comprehend languages}, {@spell detect evil and good}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect poison and disease}, {@spell locate object}, or {@spell scrying}.

For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\n\nA halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. \"We may wander amid the shadows,\" Mother Luba said. \"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\n\nSome years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls.

Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.\n\nTales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the {@i Machine of Lum the Mad}. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the {@i Mind of Metal}, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\n\nTwo creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.\n\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\n\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a {@chance 25} chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\n\nWhile any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful {@dc 25} Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}. A {@spell knock} spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\n\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\n\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\n\nOpen or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)\nMove the servant up to its speed (no action required)\nAs an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.\nWhen a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.\n\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\n\nUpon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.\n\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for 24 hours. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.\n\nBy inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\n\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a {@dc 25} Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 ({@damage 25d6}) force damage, 87 ({@damage 25d6}) lightning damage, and 87 ({@damage 25d6}) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\n\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, {@dice 2d6} days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\n\nThe servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators.

Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\n\nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\n\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\n\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\n\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically {@dice 1d6 + 1}). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property.

It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.\n\nEvery moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.\n\nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.\n\nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":"by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment","img":null},"moonstone":{"name":"Moonstone","source":"XDMG","type":"$G|XDMG","rarity":"none","description":"A white with pale-blue glow gemstone.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"moorbounder":{"name":"Moorbounder","source":"EGW","type":"MNT","rarity":"none","description":"Beasts of burden are common throughout Xhorhas, and often horses and other riding animals are the best or only option.

The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial properties}\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial property}\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental properties}\n\nThe random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.\n\nEach of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:\n\nThe {@item chronolometer|AI}\nThe {@item dimensional loop|AI}\nThe {@item far gear|AI}\nThe {@item rotor of return|AI}\nThe {@item timepiece of travel|AI}\nThe {@item wheel of stars|AI}\n\nCreatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.\n\nWhile a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.\n\nWith or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n\nWith or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.\n\nWhile all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save {@dc 17}): {@spell contact other plane} (3 charges), {@spell demiplane} (6 charges), {@spell gate} (7 charges), {@spell plane shift} (5 charges), or {@spell teleportation circle} (3 charges).

A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.\n\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\n\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards.

The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.\n\nThe Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom.\n\nThe Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.\n\nThe Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\n\nAs long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a {@creature ghost}.\n\nWhile attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide).\n\nThe Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:\n\nYou can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\nYou can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save {@dc 17}) by expending the necessary number of charges: {@spell Bigby's hand} (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), {@spell cone of cold} (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as {@spell flesh to stone} except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), {@spell ice storm} (2 charges), {@spell Otiluke's freezing sphere} (3 charges), {@spell sleet storm} (1 charge), {@spell spike growth} (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or {@spell wall of ice} (2 charges).\nYou can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: {@condition charmed}, {@condition exhaustion}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, {@condition petrified}, and {@condition poisoned}. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 ({@dice 1d10}) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.\n\nThe Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a {@creature djinni} in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.\n\nThe ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"ring of x-ray vision":{"name":"Ring of X-ray Vision","source":"XDMG","type":"RG|XDMG","rarity":"rare","description":"While wearing this ring, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute.

Similar legends across various worlds, all describing stones that grow buildings and islands from magic, like a house from a seed, suggest the Stone of Creation is not a unique artifact—or that all the various pieces of it are derived from a single source of stone even larger than sages imagine.\n\nThe raw, black stone appears flaky like slate but is as hard as granite and marbled with veins of gold and platinum. The original, complete Stone of Creation took the form of a blocky slab like a standing stone, but it may be impossible to know the Stone's true size, or if the concept of a \"whole\" Stone of Creation even applies to the artifact. Perhaps other slabs and boulders made from the Stone have been scattered across the multiverse, being cut down and recombed through interplanar movements and the magic of the artifacts themselves.\n\nThe Stone of Creation has the following random properties:\n\n2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} properties\n1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property\n\nWhile attuned to the Stone of Creation, you are proficient with {@item mason's tools|PHB} and can use them to cut pieces from the Stone's slab, thereby creating lesser artifacts.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is a source for smaller artifacts that derive their power from it. These pieces allow you to shape and bestow a portion of the slab's power for yourself or others.\n\nYou can cut pieces in two general sizes: a {@item chip of creation|AitFR-AVT} or a {@item keystone of creation|AitFR-AVT}. These lesser artifacts require their own attunement.\n\nUp to eleven chips of creation can be created from the existing slab, plus up to nine keystones. A chip resembles a flake of rock about the size of an adult human's hand. A keystone is at least five times that thickness.\n\nWhen all chips and keystones have been cut away, a portion of the Stone remains but proves impervious to additional attempts to cut or chisel pieces from it. This smallest version of the Stone is the same size as a Tiny creature.\n\nAlthough the Stone of Creation cannot create structures or demiplanes of its own, while you are attuned to it you can revise or renovate any structure or demiplane created by a keystone or chip, provided you are within 1 mile of the Stone and you can see or otherwise perceive the structure or demiplane. For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur. These changes cannot deal damage or directly harm a creature. A dispelled structure gradually recedes and diminishes to nothing, leaving creatures unharmed.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is a strange artifact that can be divided into smaller artifacts, yet the Stone is impervious to most damage. Only the smith attuned to the Stone can carve it. Destroying the Stone's lesser, derived artifacts (and their creations) does no damage to the Stone itself.\n\nThe Stone of Creation is destroyed if it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck with a forked metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell). The Stone then shatters into harmless, inert shards of rock. Places created by the slab's chips and keystones crumble, decay, or fade away to nothing after the Stone of Creation is destroyed.

The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\n\nThe aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.\n\nWhen your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A {@spell remove curse} spell cast on you has a {@chance 20} chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a {@spell greater restoration} spell does so automatically.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the {@creature aboleth} learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\n\nThe Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\nThe Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n\nWhile in stone form, the {@creature aboleth} isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains.

In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.\n\nStrahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.\n\nThe hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a {@item sun blade}:\n\nWhile grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the Sunsword.\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} radiant damage.\nThe sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n\nThe Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying it or wielding it.\n\nThe Sunsword's special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"survival mantle":{"name":"Survival Mantle","source":"VGM","type":"Medium Armor","rarity":"unknown","description":"This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest.

After using the breath weapon, you gain 2 levels of {@condition exhaustion}.\n20 | Dahlver-Nar's Tooth (dusty human molar) | 1 {@creature priest} | As an action you can call on a divine force to come to your aid. Describe the assistance you seek, and the DM decides the nature of the intervention (the effect of any cleric spell would be appropriate). Once this property is used, it can't be used again for 7 days.\n\nTo sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.\n\nTo implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.\n\nOnce all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.\n\nEach tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate.

Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\n\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\n\nThe Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile.

This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an {@spell astral projection} spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes {@condition invisible}, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\n\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an {@spell astral projection}'s silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\n\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires {@status concentration} can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.\n\nWhen first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\n\n1/day: {@spell conjure animals}, {@spell summon lesser demons|XGE}\n1/7 days: {@spell conjure minor elementals}, {@spell conjure woodland beings}, {@spell summon greater demon|XGE}\n1/month: {@spell conjure elemental}, {@spell conjure fey}\n\nThe Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a {@spell wish} spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative {@chance 10} chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\n\nThere are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates {@dice 1d4 + 1} random beneficial properties and {@dice 1d4 + 1} detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\n\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.\n\n(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\n\nThe Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.\n\nd100 | Beneficial Property | Detrimental Property\n01 | You have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement. | You are {@condition blinded}.\n02 | You can cast the {@spell speak with animals} spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice. | All animals despise you.

Creatures vulnerable to cold damage take triple damage from the True-Ice Shards, rather than double.\n\nAfter you damage a creature with the shards, you may use a bonus action to force the creature to make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature that took the damage becomes vulnerable to cold damage for 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until after you have finished a long rest.\n\nAs a reaction to being attacked, you use the rapier to increase your defense, adding +3 to your AC until the end of your next turn. If you attack with the rapier before the end of your next turn, you do not have its +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\nWhile attuned to the True-Ice Shards, you can use an action to cast the {@spell Detect Thoughts} spell (save {@dc 20}), targeting any creature you have previously met. If the targeted creature is on a different plane of existence, the spell fails.\n\nAs long as you maintain {@status concentration}, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to the focused creature. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—as long as the focus and {@status concentration} continue.\n\nYou can use the True-Ice Shards to cast a variety of divination spells. {@spell Locate Animals or Plants}, {@spell Locate Creature}, and {@spell Locate Object} may be cast at will, and don't have a maximum range. Other limitations of the spells still apply, and they can't detect subjects on other planes of existence.\n\nAdditionally, you may cast {@spell Scrying} (with a spell save DC of 20) and Find the Path. Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again.\n\nWhile Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will. That aside, the shards can be destroyed when subjected to a sufficient source of heat. A few such sources include the inside of an active volcano, a continuous source of Hellfire, or a powerful fire spell cast at 9th level.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"truth serum":{"name":"Truth Serum","source":"XDMG","type":"G|XPHB","rarity":"none","description":"A creature subjected to Truth Serum must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or have the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition for 1 hour.

These Undead don't perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.\n\nThe Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} out to 120 feet.\n\nThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.\n\nThe wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.\n\nTo further Orcus's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.\n\nDestroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\n\nBathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":true,"img":null},"wand of paralysis":{"name":"Wand of Paralysis","source":"XDMG","type":"WD|XDMG","rarity":"rare","description":"This wand has 7 charges.

The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.\n\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the {@creature storm giant} Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.\n\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is {@condition paralyzed} and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains {@condition paralyzed} until it is separated from the throne.\n\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.\n\nThe throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:\n\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell lightning bolt} (spell save {@dc 19}) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 ({@damage 14d6}) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the {@spell globe of invulnerability} spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\n\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an {@creature ancient blue dragon} that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an {@creature ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's} bite and claw attacks.\n\nThe Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@damage 20d6}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.","flavor":"","cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"wyvern poison":{"name":"Wyvern Poison","source":"XDMG","type":"G|XPHB","rarity":"none","description":"A creature subjected to Wyvern Poison makes a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw, taking 24 ({@damage 7d6}) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"xen'drik trinket":{"name":"Xen'drik Trinket","source":"ERLW","type":"Adventuring Gear","rarity":"none","description":"d8 | Trinket\n1 | A punched ticket for a voyage from Sharn to Stormreach\n2 | A scorpion's barb engraved with a single Elvish letter\n3 | A copper coin so big you could use it as a dinner plate\n4 | An image of an elf warrior engraved on a giant's tooth\n5 | A single page from a giant wizard's spellbook, bearing an incomplete spell\n6 | A scrap of parchment, part of a map of Stormreach\n7 | A small book titled {@i Feersome Beests of Zendrik}\n8 | A scrimshaw carving of a sahuagin","flavor":null,"cost":null,"weight":null,"slot":null,"img":null},"yahcha":{"name":"Yahcha","source":"ToA","type":"Adventuring Gear","rarity":"none","description":"A yahcha (pronounced YAH-chah) is a harmless, meaty beetle about the size of a human hand, which feeds on worms and maggots.

The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.\n\nThe Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.\n\nAll creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:\n\nWhile you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.\nAs an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.\nYou can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the {@spell control weather} spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.\n\nAny creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw, taking 180 ({@damage 20d10 + 70}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.
