/* card-compact.css
   Compact merchant mini-card grid & buy-strip rules now live in
   styles/globals.scss under the "Merchant mini-card grid" section.

   This file is kept as a stub so existing imports like
   `import "../styles/card-compact.css";`
   continue to work without double-defining .merchant-grid.
