# DNDNext Living Documentation Index

Updated: 2026-10-08

This directory contains the project's living handoff, roadmap, architecture, subsystem, and evidence documents. For active work, **live Supabase + current GitHub source/validators/deployment state outrank prose** if they conflict.

## Start here

1. `DNDNext_Current_Handoff_Prompt.md` — canonical long-form takeover brief. Read the **2026-10-08 override** first.
2. `Next_Chat_Handoff_2026-10-07_Grim_Hollow_Tarot.md` — current focused Grim Hollow/Tarot continuation handoff, updated 2026-10-08.
3. `CHARACTER_FORGE_SUBCLASS_ARTWORK_STATUS.md` — current Tarot coverage/resolver/selector status.
4. `CHARACTER_FORGE_TAROT_SUBCLASS_ARTWORK_CHECKLIST.md` — approved and remaining Grim Hollow card queue.
5. `CHARACTER_FORGE_TAROT_SUBCLASS_CARD_STANDARD.md` — authoritative card dimensions, layout, art direction, and QA contract.
6. `CHARACTER_FORGE_TAROT_SUBCLASS_ART_HANDOFF.md` — current artwork maintenance workflow.
7. `Character_Progression_v3_Implementation_Status.md` — progression authority pointer plus merged PR #202 reconciliation.
8. `Documentation_Refresh_Manifest.md` — trust order and current queue.
9. `CHATGPT_REPO_WRITE_PROCEDURE.md` before direct GitHub/Supabase mutation.

## Current code checkpoint

Current production authority is `main`.

Consolidated state as of 2026-10-08:

- PR #199 merged the accepted floating ruined-library subclass Tarot selector.
- PR #202 merged Metamagic Adept nested choice support, invocation detail fallback, and Profile-style Forge spell browsing.
- The 12 currently approved Grim Hollow expansion Tarot cards are all installed and mapped on `main`.
- PR #203 remains open and unmerged for the separate source-backed Grim Hollow Player's Guide spells/items/subclasses import.
- The current runtime-visible pre-import deck remains 149/149 covered; the 12 approved Grim Hollow cards are staged presentation assets until their catalogue lands.
- Remaining Grim Hollow Tarot creation queue: **24** cards; next batch Fighter.
- Consolidation commit `076a9b92e3d492f2dd4867d418477997ca0b4852` deployed to Vercel production **READY** and `/profile` returned HTTP 200.

Always re-fetch current `main`, PR #203 if touching the source-content import, and live Supabase only when the requested work is database-backed.

## Current live database checkpoint

Supabase project: `DnDWeb` / `ucggczovhmauhshvhusx`.

Latest relevant registered migrations:

- `20260921152546 admin_site_activity_v1`;
- `20260921153151 admin_site_activity_acl_fix`;
- `20260921153328 admin_site_activity_retention_v1`;
- `20260921185225 admin_site_activity_hardening_v1`.

Read `Auth_Navigation_Admin_Activity_Status.md` for the privacy model, grants, rate-bound anonymous ingestion, and signed-out attribution fix.

The planned Realistic Dice Phase 1 still does **not** require a Supabase migration. Later tactical dice presentation should consume existing authoritative encounter RPC/combat-log outcomes rather than introduce client-side combat authority.

## Realistic Dice future subsystem

Read `Realistic_Dice_Roller_Architecture_Roadmap.md` before implementing or modifying the future roller.

### Why this exists

The current Character Forge Abilities tab contains a CSS-based dice-tray/result-die prototype. It preserves the correct Forge roll objects and allocation behavior, but its trajectories are presentation-only and should not become the permanent cross-site engine.

The reusable subsystem is planned to support:

- Forge generated ability totals;
- Character Sheet ability/skill/save/initiative rolls;
- damage/healing dice later;
- future tactical combat roll presentation;
- true d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 polyhedral dice;
- a Forge-specific aggregate `resultCube` for values such as 4d6-drop-lowest totals.

### Locked dice boundary

**Rules decide the result; physics only visualizes it.**

Do not let Rapier/Three client physics decide or replace:

- attack/save/damage outcomes;
- generated ability totals;
- advantage/disadvantage choice;
- tactical pathing/occupancy;
- LOS/cover/range;
- initiative ordering;
- encounter turn/action state.

Dice rigid-body collision rules are deliberately separate from the existing discrete tactical hex rules.

### Planned implementation order

1. finish/accept the current Forge checkpoint;
2. create a dedicated Realistic Dice branch/PR from the accepted commit rather than widening #176 indefinitely;
3. build the reusable core + Forge adapter first;
4. add Character Sheet adapter only after Phase 1 acceptance;
5. add tactical adapter when tactical work resumes;
6. consider a global overlay host only after multiple real consumers justify it.

## Character Forge / progression / runtime documents

- `Character_Forge_Training_Redesign_Status.md` — player Training design/history subledger.
- `Character_Forge_Training_Browser_Implementation_2026-08-21.md` — Training browser implementation details.
- `Character_Forge_Background_Audit.md` — accepted Background audit/presentation history after merged PR #175; use for provenance, not as an active layout queue.
- `Unified_Character_Forge_Status.md` — controlling shared Forge/progression/runtime architecture.
- `Player_Forge_Choice_Routing_and_Source_Magic_Status.md` — player-facing choice placement and source-magic authority.
- `Character_Progression_Foundation.md` — normalized creation/progression model.
- `Character_Progression_and_Higher_Level_Forge.md` — direct higher-level creation vs earned progression.
- `Pending_Rest_Runtime_Choices_Status.md` — post-rest attention vs optional replacement classification.
- `Player_Forge_Starting_Magic_v3_Status.md` — starting magic.
- `Player_Forge_Starting_Equipment_Status.md` — starting equipment/wealth/currency.
- feature-specific `*_Runtime_Status.md` ledgers — runtime cadence and restoration authority.

Core cadence rule: persistent source-owned acquisitions belong to Forge/progression; proficiency-dependent choices belong to Training; spell-centric choices belong to Spells; rest decisions belong to runtime; per-use decisions belong to action UI; future campaign-event unlocks belong to quest/dialogue authority when that subsystem exists.

## Character Sheet / roll integration

Current reusable sheet flow includes `CharacterSheet5e` → `onRoll` → `CharacterSheetPanel` → profile/NPC parent → `CharacterSheetRollResult`.

This existing structured-result seam should be adapted by a future `CharacterSheetDiceOverlay`. Do not rewrite all sheet formulas solely to introduce 3D presentation.

## Tactical encounter / roll integration

- `Tactical_Encounter_Combat_Roadmap_Blueprint.md` plus current tactical phase ledgers — combat roadmap/status.
- `pages/encounters/*`, `components/encounter/*`, `utils/encounterHex.js`, and live encounter RPCs are current tactical authority.
- `TacticalAttackResultPanel.js` already consumes authoritative combat-log attack results.

Future tactical dice should consume the existing RPC/combat-log result and may use command/request identity as visual-seed input. Do **not** reuse Rapier dice collision rules for encounter movement/pathfinding.

## Species baseline

- `Forge_Post170_Species_Artwork_Status.md` — accepted Species baseline after merged PRs #171–#173.
- `Forge_Species_Family_Submenu_Status.md` — Species family/setting-row identity and persistence rules.
- `Forge_Source_Presentation_and_Species_Variants_Status.md` — structured source-presentation foundation/history.

Species is considered complete enough to freeze unless a concrete defect is reproduced. `Gift of the Aetherborn` remains visible/source-backed and its future unlock belongs to Game-Master-defined quest/NPC dialogue progression.

## Background baseline

Background is accepted after merged PR #175. Its reusable family banners/crests/icons and compact Background dossier are now baseline.

Audit omissions/parsing/routing against the source payload before changing anything that merely looks uneven. Do not silently rebalance source Backgrounds.

## Training subledger

Training remains important because PR #176 started there. Preserve the accepted direction and source ownership documented in `Character_Forge_Training_Redesign_Status.md`, including player/NPC isolation, Skills/Feats view separation, canonical tool↔Trade Skill mapping, no double-spend, and existing completion authority.

Do not regress Training while working on Class/Abilities/dice presentation.

## Character sheet / inventory / crafting

- `Crafting_Equipment_CharacterSheet_Tactical_Pipeline.md` — canonical item/inventory/equip/sheet/tactical boundaries.
- `Character_Sheet_Formula_Reference.md` — ability/save/skill/AC/initiative/passive formulas.
- `NPC_Character_Sheet_Selection_Reconciliation.md` — selection/stale-response ownership.
- `Town_Crafter_Current_Status.md` — town crafter/profile state.
- `Source_Patch_Pipeline_Audit.md` — source-bake / validator pipeline.

After the Forge is complete, the user wants to circle back to a broader crafting redesign: a unified crafting-material list whose material has craft-specific effects, plus possible expansion of individual tools into granular craft skills/recipe systems. That is deliberately separate from Realistic Dice and PR #176.

## Tactical encounter / sprites / security

- `Tactical_Encounter_Combat_Roadmap_Blueprint.md` plus latest tactical phase ledgers — combat roadmap/status.
- `Dawn_High_Quality_Prototype_Plan.md`, `Sprite_Production_Work_Map.md`, `Sprite_Production_Art_Bible.md`, `Sprite_Production_Run_Log.md` — sprite work.
- `Security_Hardening_Roadmap_Status.md` — security/database hardening.

Always inspect live grants/functions before modifying authenticated `SECURITY DEFINER` surfaces.

## Protected boundaries

Character Forge or Realistic Dice work does not authorize changes to world-map, town/city-map behavior, route/travel/weather/camp/clock logic, tactical combat execution/movement/pathing, crafting/inventory execution, merchants, or unrelated runtime systems.

`components/MapPageClient.js` remains protected unless Paul explicitly requests world-map work. World-map and town/city-map behavior must never be casually combined.
